## What is Feelback?
Feelback is a service allowing to collect any type of feedback for your content, such as _likes_, _reactions_, _ratings_, _suggestions_, _error reporting_ and so on. It integrates easily with any website with prebuilt components.

You can easily add:
- **Likes** to blog posts
- _"Is this page useful?"_ with **up/down votes** on documentation pages
- **Emoji reactions** to sections, parts or comments
- _"Send feedback"_ **form** for tips, appreciations or error reporting, with custom data
